/**
 * Normalizer for `public/**\/*.webp`. Run: `bun run images:optimize`, commit the result.
 * NOT a build step — the artifacts are committed.
 *
 * Why this exists: the site serves plain `<img>` with `images: { unoptimized: true }`,
 * so there is no srcset and **the source file's dimensions are exactly what every
 * visitor downloads**. Nothing right-sizes these at request time any more.
 *
 * Most of the weight here was over-ENCODING, not over-sizing: the looklook-pet gallery
 * shipped 0.36–0.45 bytes/px where a good WebP photo is 0.10–0.20, at dimensions that
 * were already correct. So resizing is the exception (see `TARGETS`) and re-encoding the
 * genuinely bloated files is the rule.
 *
 * A file is only rewritten when there is a REASON to — it is oversized, or it is
 * over-encoded. Re-encoding something already near target buys a few percent and costs a
 * generation of quality, so files that are already fine are left completely alone. That
 * matters most for the project covers, three of which are printed on A4 (see FLOORS).

 * ⚠️ HARD FLOORS — going under any of these breaks something with no error:
 *   - every `cover.webp` under `issue/` ≥ 1080: `pngDataUri(cover, CARD_SIZE)` in
 *     app/card/projects/[id]/route.tsx resizes with `withoutEnlargement: true`, so a
 *     smaller source is NOT upscaled — Satori stretches it across the 1080×608 slot and
 *     the share card goes quietly blurry. Google's structured-data guidance wants ≥1200,
 *     and app/cv/page.tsx prints three of them on A4 at 182mm (1600px = 223 DPI).
 *     No cover appears below for exactly this reason.
 *   - `logo/logo.webp` ≥ 512: app/manifest.ts declares its size to Chrome. Keep the two
 *     in step.
 *   - the `logo/*` org marks ≥ 112: JSON-LD `Organization.logo` minimum.
