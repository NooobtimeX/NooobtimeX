/**
 * The drift gate. Run: `bun run icons:check` — wired into `bun run build`.
 *
 * Fails when `common/data` references an icon that `lib/og-icons.generated.json` does
 * not carry, i.e. someone added a skill and forgot `bun run icons:generate`. Without
 * this the failure is silent and remote: a blank slot on a social card nobody looks at
 * until it is already shared.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT import `./collections` — this runs on every build, and pulling
 * in 26.7 MB of icon JSON to check 175 strings would reintroduce the cost this whole
 * pipeline exists to remove. It compares two key sets, nothing more.
 *
 * Compares PARSED CONTENT, not bytes: `bun run lint` runs `prettier . --write` with no
 * `.prettierignore`, so the artifact gets reformatted and a byte comparison would flap.
