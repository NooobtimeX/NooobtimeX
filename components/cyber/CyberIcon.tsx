/**
 * A SERVER-side `<Icon>`: inlines the SVG instead of fetching it.
 *
 * `@iconify/react`'s `Icon` is a client component that requests its SVG from
 * api.iconify.design after mount. The measured result was that the prerendered HTML
 * contained **zero** inline `<svg>` across 69 render sites — every icon blank until a
 * third-party round-trip finished, and no iconography at all wherever that host is slow
 * or blocked. Preloading the data does not help: `Icon` still emits `<span></span>`
 * under `renderToString` even when the icon is registered via `addIcon`. The only way
 * to get an icon into the HTML is to render the SVG ourselves.
 *
 * Use this in server components. Client components keep `@iconify/react` — pulling this
 * module into a client bundle would drag `lib/og-icons.generated.json` (~138 KB) with
 * it, which is the cost this whole pipeline exists to avoid.
 *
 * Throws on an unknown name rather than rendering nothing, matching `iconDataUri` in
 * `lib/og-assets.ts`. A silently invisible icon is the failure mode the generate/check
 * pipeline was built to prevent, and `bun run icons:check` already gates the build.
